                      The Hour of Code, initiated by Code.org, is a global event aimed at making computer science accessible through self-guided tutorials. Held annually during Computer Science Education Week, it fosters creativity, problem-solving, and foundational coding skills for learners of all levels.It is especially effective given that this event enables school children, who have never had the opportunity to learn about computer science, to experience and interact with coding. The program provides a great way to expand the students' knowledge in programming and provides them with a fun introduction into how coding works.

                <h2> Early preperations</h2>
                <p>
                  To organizing this event, the team arranged a meeting with the administrative body of the highschool and discussed arranging the Hour of Code. The highschool accepted the proposal and both parties agreed on an hour and prepared classrooms for the event. The team printed certificates for each student that was going to participate in the Hour of Code and successfully complet the short course.

                <p>
                  Team Mono arranged an Hour of Code at the FRITL (Physics, Mathematics, and Informatics) highschool to celebrate the Hour of Code with the students of the highschool. They organized an interactive Hour of Code workshop, blending the three disciplines into an engaging coding experience.

                <h2>Contributions and Result</h2>
                <p>The Hour of Code with ended the majority of the students finishing the tasks that were given to them with both cooperation and competition between themselves. All the effort put forward by Team Mono and the cooperation provided by the high school, resulted in a very productive hour of coding where students got the chance to see for themselves in a simple sense what computer science was about. Quite a few of them approached the team and their teachers afterwards with enthusiasm hungry for more.</p>
