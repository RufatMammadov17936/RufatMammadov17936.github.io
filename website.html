                      Team Mono, a group of SITE students from ADA, started the website creation project as a homework assignment for their Principles of Information. Using the knowledge they gained from the popular learning platform Codeacademy.com they tried to make website based on the aesthetics of minimalism and elegance. In this process they also learned to use GitHub, a well-known platform for version control and team collaboration, to speed up their development process and collaborate effectively. Team Mono`s project show that it is possible to for everyone to learn markup languages skills from online sources which are freely available.

                <h2>First Steps</h2>
                <p>
                  The team started by each member individually studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at CodeAcademy, and were overwhelmed by the amount of new information they needed to learn. However, the course was built for beginners to be gradually immersed in the field of web development.

                <h2>Mono Design</h2>
                <p>
                  Monochrome is a term derived from the Greek words "monos" (one) and "chroma" (color). It has been utilized in art and design for millennia, with its popularity varying throughout time. Monochrome designs are sometimes made by using multiple shades of a single hue, which may provide depth and character to an otherwise plain design.
One of the primary benefits of utilizing monochromatic images is their simplicity. By restricting the color palette, designers may focus on other design components like composition, texture, and typography. This minimalist approach may result in an attractive and sophisticated design.
Monochrome designs have a vintage feel to them since they were often employed in early photography and cinema. Indeed, some of the most famous images and films of the twentieth century were shot in black and white, adding to the nostalgic appeal of monochrome. Today, many designers and photographers employ monochrome in their work, either to pay respect to this traditional look or to develop a new twist on it.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The project served as a way to expand their knowledge of both web-design and development where they learned both the technicalities and the complex syntax of the languages while also adding a touch of atristic expression.
